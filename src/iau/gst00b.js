**
**  Greenwich apparent sidereal time (consistent with IAU 2000
**  resolutions but using the truncated nutation model IAU 2000B).
**
**  This function is part of the International Astronomical Union's
**  SOFA (Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy) software collection.
**
**  Status:  support function.
**
**  Given:
**     uta,utb    double    UT1 as a 2-part Julian Date (Notes 1,2)
**
**  Returned (function value):
**                double    Greenwich apparent sidereal time (radians)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) The UT1 date uta+utb is a Julian Date, apportioned in any
**     convenient way between the argument pair.  For example,
**     JD=2450123.7 could be expressed in any of these ways, among
**     others:
**
**             uta            utb
**
**         2450123.7           0.0       (JD method)
**         2451545.0       -1421.3       (J2000 method)
**         2400000.5       50123.2       (MJD method)
**         2450123.5           0.2       (date & time method)
**
**     The JD method is the most natural and convenient to use in cases
**     where the loss of several decimal digits of resolution is
**     acceptable.  The J2000 and MJD methods are good compromises
**     between resolution and convenience.  For UT, the date & time
**     method is best matched to the algorithm that is used by the Earth
**     Rotation Angle function, called internally:  maximum precision is
**     delivered when the uta argument is for 0hrs UT1 on the day in
**     question and the utb argument lies in the range 0 to 1, or vice
**     versa.
**
**  2) The result is compatible with the IAU 2000 resolutions, except
**     that accuracy has been compromised for the sake of speed and
**     convenience in two respects:
**
**     . UT is used instead of TDB (or TT) to compute the precession
**       component of GMST and the equation of the equinoxes.  This
**       results in errors of order 0.1 mas at present.
**
**     . The IAU 2000B abridged nutation model (McCarthy & Luzum, 2001)
**       is used, introducing errors of up to 1 mas.
**
**  3) This GAST is compatible with the IAU 2000 resolutions and must be
**     used only in conjunction with other IAU 2000 compatible
**     components such as precession-nutation.
**
**  4) The result is returned in the range 0 to 2pi.
**
**  5) The algorithm is from Capitaine et al. (2003) and IERS
**     Conventions 2003.
**
**  Called:
**     iauGmst00    Greenwich mean sidereal time, IAU 2000
**     iauEe00b     equation of the equinoxes, IAU 2000B
**     iauAnp       normalize angle into range 0 to 2pi
